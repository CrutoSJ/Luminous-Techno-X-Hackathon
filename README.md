## Overview
**Problem:** Many solar energy users face high electricity costs due to fluctuating Time-of-Use (ToU) tariffs and limited tools for aligning energy usage with these tariffs.  
**Solution:** Our platform offers a dynamic approach to energy cost optimization by:
- Monitoring real-time tariffs
- Analyzing energy consumption patterns
- Scheduling high-energy devices based on tariff changes
- Optimizing solar energy usage

This application uses Python and Flask for the backend, with an interactive front-end to view live data.

## Features
### Core Functionality
1. **Real-Time Tariff Monitoring:**  
   - Fetches live ToU pricing to guide users in cost-saving decisions.
   - Displays current and forecasted tariff data.

2. **Energy Consumption Analytics:**  
   - Provides insights into energy usage patterns and potential savings.
   - Uses data analytics tools (e.g., Pandas, NumPy) to generate recommendations.

3. **Smart Scheduling:**  
   - Automatically schedules high-energy appliances for low-cost periods.
   - Allows manual overrides for maximum control.

4. **Weather-Based Solar Optimization:**  
   - Adjusts solar energy availability based on weather conditions.
   - Increases efficiency by adapting usage patterns to solar output.

5. **Real-Time Dashboard:**  
   - Displays real-time tariff, energy consumption, and solar energy production.
   - Interactive charts provide comprehensive, actionable insights.

## Architecture
The platform comprises three primary layers:
1. **Frontend Layer:** Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js for data visualization.
2. **Backend Layer:** Flask server that processes and manages real-time data.
3. **Database Layer:** SQL or NoSQL databases for storing user profiles, tariff history, energy usage, and solar data.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
- API key for a weather service (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api))

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-solar-management.git
   cd dynamic-solar-management

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Set up environment variables:
   export WEATHER_API_KEY='your_api_key'

4. Run the Flask server:
   python app.py

5. Access the app at `http://localhost:5000`.
